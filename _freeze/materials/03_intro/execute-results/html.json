Briefly, cells from a human cell \nline (U-2 0S) were treated with Nocodazole to inhibit the polymerisation of\nmicrotubules and block the transition beyond the prometaphase stage of M-phase.\nAfter 18-hours of treatment, the cells were released from cell cycle inhibition \nby withdrawing Nocodazole. Samples were taken in triplicate at 0, 6 and 23-hours\npost-withdrawl to generate 3 x M-phase samples, 3 x G1-phase samples and 3 x\ndesynchronised samples. A sample of cells was also taken prior to Nocodazole\ntreatment as an additional control, thus giving a total of 10 samples. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A schematic summary of the experimental design used to generate the use case data.](figs/experimental_plan_updated.png){#fig-experimental-method fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nTo measure protein abundance via bottom-up mass spectrometry, protein samples \nwere digested to peptides using trypsin (an enzyme which cleaves proteins at \nthe C-terminus of arginine and lysine residues, except where there is an \nadjacent proline residue). The same quantity of peptide from each sample was then\nlabelled using Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labels. This allows all of the samples to \nbe combined into a single pooled MS sample, thus reducing technical variability\nand MS time, as well as ensuring quantification of the same peptides in each \nsamples. The TMT labelling strategy is outlined below in @tbl-data-structure.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-data-structure .cell tbl-cap='Sample information and TMT labelling strategy in the use case experiment'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Sample Name |Timepoint     | Replicate|Tag  |\n|:-----------|:-------------|---------:|:----|\n|Control     |Pre-treatment |        NA|126  |\n|M_1         |0hrs          |         1|127N |\n|M_2         |0hrs          |         2|127C |\n|M_3         |0hrs          |         3|128N |\n|G1_1        |6hrs          |         1|128C |\n|G1_2        |6hrs          |         2|129N |\n|G1_3        |6hrs          |         3|129C |\n|DS_1        |23hrs         |         1|130N |\n|DS_2        |23hrs         |         2|130C |\n|DS_3        |23hrs         |         3|131  |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Isobaric peptide labelling using Tandem Mass Tags (TMT)\n\nAs outlined above, the use-case experiment made use of tandem mass tag (TMT)\nlabelling. TMT reagents are **isobaric** chemical labels that can be covalently \nlinked to peptide amine groups, either at the peptide N-terminus or at lysine\n(K) residues. These reagents are currently available in kits (referred to as\nTMTplexes) containing 6 (TMT6plex^TM^), 10 (TMT10plex^TM^), 16 (TMTpro 16plex^TM^) \nor 18 (TMTpro 18plex^TM^) TMT labels. The isobaric nature of TMT reagents means\nthat all of the labels within a TMTplex have the same overall mass. However, \nthey differ in how this mass is distributed between their two variable regions - \nthe **reporter** and **mass normaliser**. The structure of a TMT label is shown \nbelow in @fig-tmt-structure. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The chemical structure of a TMT label.](figs/tmt_structure.jpg){#fig-tmt-structure fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAfter TMT labelling each sample with a different TMT reagent the same peptide\nwill have an identical mass but be differentially labelled across samples. The \nsamples are then pooled together and run on the MS as a single **multiplexed**\nsample. In the MS1 spectra it is not possible to distinguish how much of each\npeptide (peak) was derived from each sample because all of the labelled peptides\nstill have the same overall mass. During fragmentation, however, a cleavable linker\nwithin the TMT label is broken, thereby releasing a section of the label called\nthe **reporter ion**. The mass of this reporter ion is different between TMT \nlabels due to differences in the distribution of isotopes (C^13^ and N^15^)\nbetween the **mass reporter** and **mass normalizer** regions. As a result, the \nspectra of fragment ions will contain one peak per reporter ion and the relative \nintensity of these ions can be used to calculate the relative abundance of the \nidentified peptide across the labelled samples.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Add graphic showing TMT MS1 and MS2\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThis means that TMT labelling can be used for the **relative quantification** of \npeptides (and in turn proteins) across samples. Here we will use the relative\nreporter ion intensity of our TMT labels to compare abundance between samples\ntaken throughout the cell cycle. If we wanted to carry out absolute quantification \nof proteins, TMT labelling would not be an appropriate method.\n\n**Note** **put in box** **relative vs. abusolute quant**\n\n## MS2- vs. MS3-based TMT quantitaion\n\nOriginally the reporter ion of a TMT reagent was released by fragmentation of \nthe precursor peptide. This meant that the reporter ion signals could be \ncalculated based on MS2 spectra, and hence TMT quantitation was done at the MS2\nlevel. However, different precursor peptides can have very similar m/z values,\nresulting in their MS1 peaks being very close together. When one of these\nprecursors is selected for fragmentation it is possible for other precursors to\nbe unintentionally co-isolated within the same fragmentation window. This \nresults in **co-isolation interference** since the reporter ions present at MS2\nare not only from the identified peptide but also any other co-isolated peptides.\n\nMore recently, MS3-based quantitation has been applied to reduce the problem of\nco-isolation interference and increase quantitation accuracy when using TMT labels\n@Ting2011. In this approach the initial round of precursor fragmentation only uses \na weak fragmentation method (e.g., collision induced dissociation, CID) to ensure\nthat TMT reporter ions are not broken off at MS2. The most abundance fragment ions\nfrom MS2 are then selected for a second round of fragmentation, this time using\na stronger force (e.g., high-energy collision dissociation) so that the TMT\nreporter ions are released. Since the MS2 fragment ions derived from the intended\nprecursor peptide are more abundant than the unwanted MS2 fragments from \nco-isolated peptides, the MS3 fragments and reporter ions provide a much cleaner\nquantitation of the identified precursor peptide. The MS3 reporter ion \nquantitation is almost purely from the peptide that we want, not from a mixture\nof all co-isolated peptides.\n\nThe specific MS3 data acquisition approach used to generate our data was \nsynchronous precursor selection (SPS)-MS3. In simple terms, the SPS method \nallows us to select multiple MS2 fragments for additional fragmentation to the\nMS3 level, rather than just one @McAlister2014.\n\n\n## Identification search of the raw MS data\n\nHaving analysed the pooled TMT sample via MS, the raw MS were processed using \nProteome Discoverer v3.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). This software is one of \nseveral that can be used to carry out a database search to identify and \nquantify peptide sequences, and therefore proteins, from raw MS data. Others \ninclude [MaxQuant](https://www.maxquant.org), \n[FragPipe](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org) and\n[PEAKS](https://www.bioinfor.com/peaks-online/) among others.\n\nBriefly, database searching of MS data involves comparing the observed MS spectra\nto expected MS spectra generated via in silico digestion of a selected protein \ndatabase. Since the use-case data used human cells, we provided the human proteome\nto Proteome Discoverer as the database for searching. We also provided a \ndatabase of common contaminants that could be present in our sample due to (i)\nhuman contamination (e.g., keratin from nails, hair or skin), or (ii) sample \npreparation (e.g., enzymes used for protein digestion). These two databases are\nprovided... **give link/reference to github**. The result of such a database \nsearch is a list of **peptide spectrum matches (PSMs)**, that is a list of matches\nbetween observed and expected spectra. Most software will also aggregate the \nPSM level data upward and provide output files at all data levels (PSM, peptide\nand protein). It is up to the user which output file to use for further analysis.\n\nThe starting point for this workshop and data processing workflow in R is an \noutput file from the identification search. Proteome Discoverer provides each \ndata level output as a separate `.txt` file. Here, we will use the PSM-level\n`.txt` file. \n\n\n## Starting analysis from PSM, peptide or protein level\n\nIn general, to allow for maximum control of data quality, normalisation and\naggregation it is advisable to begin analysis from the lowest possible data \nlevel. This will ensure a greater understanding of the data and facilitate\ntransparency throughout the process. \n\nFor TMT data we can start our data analysis from the PSM level. However, it is\nnot always possible to start at this level. For the analysis of label-free data\nit is advisable to begin processing at the peptide level. This is because most\nidentification searches carried out on label-free MS data utilise an algorithm\ncalled retention time (RT) alignment, which uses the match between runs (MBR)\nfunction.\n\n**What problem does retention time alignment address?**\n\nRetention time alignment aims to deal with the problem of missing values in \nlabel-free data-dependent acquisition (DDA) MS data. Since label-free samples \nare all analysed by independent MS runs, the stochastic nature of DDA means \nthat different peptides are identified and quantified between samples, hence\nthere are a high number of missing values. \n\n**How does retention time alignment work?**\n\nQuantification of label-free samples is achieved at the MS1 level. This means \nthat we have potentially useful quantitative information before we have any\npeptide identification (MS1 before MS2). In cases where a peptide is identified\nin some samples but not others, it is possible to align the retention times of\neach sample run and then compare the MS1 spectra. In this way, information can\nbe shared across runs and a peptide identification made in one run can be \nassigned to an MS1 spectra from a completely independent run, even if this\nspectrum does not have a corresponding MS2 spectrum.\n\n**Why does retention time alignment prevent analysis from PSM level?**\n\nThe process of RT alignment and MBRs occurs after the process of peptide\nspectrum matching. First, PSMs are derived from an identification search. This\nis done independently for each sample. The remaining spectra for which no PSM\nwas identified are then included in the RT alignment algorithm in an attempt to\nassign an identification. If successful, this means that there may be peptide\nlevel data in the absence of PSM level data. Hence, if we used PSM level data \nfor the processing and analysis of label-free data then we would lose out on \nthe benefit of RT alignment.\n\n\n## Summary\nThe use-case data that we will process and analyse in this workshop is a **DDA**\n**TMT-labelled** **bottom-up** proteomics dataset. The aim of the experiment is\nto calculate **relative protein abundances** between samples. This will then allow \nus to apply statistical tests to determine whether any proteins have significantly\ndifferent abundances relative to each other.\n\nAlthough many of the processing and analysis steps discussed in this course are\nalso applicable to other types of proteomics datasets (particularly label-free\nDDA bottom-up proteomics), there is no one-size-fits-all workflow for expression\nproteomics. Some aspects of the workflow would need to be adapted for other\ntypes of proteomics experiment.\n\n## References {-}",
