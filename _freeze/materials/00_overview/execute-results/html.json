Breckels - Cambridge Centre for Proteomcis, University of Cambridge\n* Charlotte Hutchings - Cambridge Centre for Proteomcis, University of Cambridge\n* Charlotte S. Dawson - Cambridge Centre for Proteomcis, University of Cambridge\n* Thomas Krueger - Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge\n\n\n## Course prerequisites \n\nThis workshop is aimed at learners who are interested in developing their skills\nusing R for the analysis of expression proteomics data. **A working knowledge of R is assumed and essential. If you are not familiar with R and the RStudio environment, you will struggle on this course.** If you are not confident using R, we strongly suggest that you\nwork through an introductory R course before attending this course. \n**A basic understanding of proteomics is also expected.** \n\n",
