Please first read through that material, since it includes background explanations and clarifications which are not repeated here.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Differential expression analysis\n\nHaving cleaned our data, aggregated from PSM to protein level, completed\na log2 transformation and normalised the data, we are now ready to carry\nout statistical analysis. \n\nThe aim of this section is to answer the\nquestion: *\"Which proteins show a significant change in abundance\nbetween the multiple cell cycle stages?\"*.\n\nOur null hypothesis is: **(H0)** The mean protein abundance is the same across cell cycle stages.\n\nOur alternative hypothesis is: **(H1)** The mean protein abundance differs across cell cycle stages.\n\n\nWe will use `limma` to perform the statistical tests using an **empirical Bayes-moderated linear model**. Please see the [Statistical analysis](./06_statistical_analysis.html) section for more details about `limma` and its application in quantitative proteomics. \n\nDepending on whether the linear model is used to perform single comparisons or multifactorial comparisons, the test statistic will either be a t-value or an F-value, respectively. Here, we will perform both, starting with assessing the overall effect of cell cycle with an F-test. The F-test does not tell us which groups are different to one another, only that the cell cycle stage does affect protein abundance. Later we will see how to perform all the pairwise comparisons with t-tests.\n\n::: callout-note\n\n### What is an F-value?\n\nAn F-value is a parametric statistical value used to compare the mean\nvalues of **three or more** groups. The F-value is the ratio of the between-group\nvariation (explained variance) and the within-group variance (unexplained variance).\nThe higher the F-value, the more significant the difference between the groups is.\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n\n### What is a t-value?\n\nA t-value is a parametric statistical value used to compare the mean\nvalues of **two** groups. The t-value is the ratio of the difference in means to\nthe standard error of the difference in means. The further away from zero that a\nt-value lies, the more significant the difference between the groups is.\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n\n### How is the p-value obtained?\n\nA p-value may be obtained from a t-value/F-value by comparing the value against an t-value/F-distribution with the appropriate degrees of freedom.\n    \n-   **degrees of freedom** = the number of observations minus the number\n    of independent variables in the model\n-   **p-value** = the probability of achieving the t-value/F-value under the\n    null hypothesis i.e., by chance\n\n:::\n\nHere, we will start by performing a comparison between three groups (M phase, G1 phase and\ndesynchronised) for each protein and obtain an F-value and p-value for each protein.\n\nFirst, we extract the suitable protein experiment. We will remove the pre-treatment sample,\nsince this condition is not replicated and so not amenable to statistical testing.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# extract the log-normalised experiment from our QFeatures object\nall_proteins <- cc_qf[[\"log_norm_proteins\"]]\n\n# subset to exclude the pre-treatment sample\nall_proteins <- all_proteins[, all_proteins$condition != 'Pre-treatment']\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Modelling with or without an intercept\n\nWhen investigating the effect of a single explanatory **categorical** variable with more than two levels, a design matrix can be created using either `model.matrix(~variable)` or\n`model.matrix(~0 + variable)`. The former will create a model that includes an intercept term, whilst the latter will not. If an intercept is included, the first level of the variable (here, M) is considered the 'baseline' and modeled by the intercept. The subsequent levels of the variable (here, G1 and Desynch) are modeled by additional terms in the model, which capture the difference between each other level and the baseline (M). This approach makes intuitive sense if one group of samples are control samples to which all other groups should be compared. Although comparisons can be made between any pair of groups when using a model with an intercept, it's less intuitive than a model without an intercept. In this experiment, none of the groups are a control group to compare to, and we wish to compare between all samples. Thus, we will model without an intercept here.\n\nFor further guidance on generating design matrices for covariates or continuous explanatory\nvariables, see [A guide to creating design matrices for gene expression experiments](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/workflows/vignettes/RNAseq123/inst/doc/designmatrices.html#design-and-contrast-matrices).\n\nBelow, we define the model matrix without any intercept term using the `model.matrix(~0 + variable)` formulation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Ensure that conditions are stored as levels of a factor \n## Explicitly define level order by cell cycle stage\nall_proteins$condition <- factor(all_proteins$condition, \n                                 levels = c(\"M\", \"G1\", \"Desynch\"))\n\n## Design a matrix containing all factors that we wish to model\ncondition <- all_proteins$condition\nm_design <- model.matrix(~0 + condition)\n\n# Rename design matrix columns to make them easier to refer to\ncolnames(m_design) <- levels(condition)\n\n## Verify\nm_design\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  M G1 Desynch\n1 1  0       0\n2 1  0       0\n3 1  0       0\n4 0  1       0\n5 0  1       0\n6 0  1       0\n7 0  0       1\n8 0  0       1\n9 0  0       1\nattr(,\"assign\")\n[1] 1 1 1\nattr(,\"contrasts\")\nattr(,\"contrasts\")$condition\n[1] \"contr.treatment\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### What are contrasts?\n\nWe also define **contrasts**. The contrasts represent comparisons\nare of interest to us, e.g M phase vs Desynchronised. This is important since we are not directly\ninterested in the parameter (mean) estimates for each group but rather\nthe differences in these parameter (mean) estimates *between* groups.\nThe `makeContrasts` function is used by passing the name we wish to give\neach contrast and how this contrast should be calculated using column\nnames from the design matrix. We also pass the `levels` argument to tell\nR where the column names come from i.e., which design matrix the\ncontrasts are being applied to.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Specify contrasts of interest\ncontrasts <- makeContrasts(G1_M = G1 - M, \n                           M_Des = M - Desynch, \n                           G1_Des = G1 - Desynch,\n                           levels = m_design)\n\n## Verify\ncontrasts\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n         Contrasts\nLevels    G1_M M_Des G1_Des\n  M         -1     1      0\n  G1         1     0      1\n  Desynch    0    -1     -1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Running an empirical Bayes moderated test using `limma`\n\nAfter we have specified the design matrix and contrasts we wish to make,\nthe next step is to apply the statistical model. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Fit linear model using the design matrix and desired contrasts\nfit_model <- lmFit(object = assay(all_proteins), design = m_design)\nfit_contrasts <- contrasts.fit(fit = fit_model, contrasts = contrasts)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe initial model has now been applied to each of the proteins in our data.

For the function to determine\nsignificance we have to provide a p-value adjustment method and\nthreshold, here we use the standard Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for FDR\nadjustment and set a threshold of `adj.P.Value < 0.01` for significance.\n\nThe `decideTests` function also takes an argument called `method`.
