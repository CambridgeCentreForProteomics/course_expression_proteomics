Moreover, some protein descriptions \ncontain useful information, but this is very limited. We still want to find out\nmore about the biological role of the statistically significant proteins so that\nwe can infer the potential effects of their abundance changes. \n\nThere are many functional analyses that could be done on the proteins with\ndifferential abundance:\n\n* Investigate the biological pathways that the proteins function within (KEGG etc.)\n* Identify potential interacting partners (IntAct, String.dc etc.)\n* Determine the subcellular localisation in which the changing proteins are found \n* Understand the co-regulation of their mRNAs (Expression Atlas)\n* Compare our changing proteins to those previously identified in other proteomic\nstudies of the cell cycle\n\n### Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis \n\nOne of the common methods used to probe the biological relevance of proteins with\nsignificant changes in abundance between conditions is to carry out Gene Ontology \n(GO) enrichment, or over-representation, analysis. \n\nThe Gene Ontology consortium have defined a set of hierarchical descriptions to \nbe assigned to genes and their resulting proteins. These descriptions are split\ninto three categories: cellular components (CC), biological processes (BP) and\nmolecular function (MF). The idea is to provide information about a protein's\nsubcellular localisation, functionality and which processes it contributes to\nwithin the cell. Hence, the overarching aim of GO enrichment analysis is to \nanswer the question: \n\n*\"Given a list of proteins found to be differentially abundant in my phenotype of interest, what are the cellular components, molecular functions and biological processes involved in this phenotype?\".*\n\nUnfortunately, just looking at the GO terms associated with our differentially\nabundant proteins is insufficient to draw any solid conclusions. For example, if\nwe find that 156 of the 468 proteins significantly\nupregulated in M phase are annotated with the GO term \"kinase activity\", it may\nseem intuitive to conclude that this biological process is important for the M-phase \nphenotype. However, if 90% of all proteins in the cell were kinases (an extreme\nexample), then we might expect to discover a high representation of the \"kinase\nactivity\" GO term in any protein list we end up with.\n\nThis leads us to the concept of an over-representation analysis. We wish to ask \nwhether any GO terms are over-represented (i.e., present at a higher frequency \nthan expected by chance) in our lists of differentially abundant proteins. In \nother words, we need to know how many proteins with a GO term *could* have\nshown differential abundance in our experiment vs. how many proteins with this\nGO term *did* show differential abundance in our experiment. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nego_up <- enrichGO(gene = sig_up$protein, \n                   universe = M_Desynch_results$protein, \n                   OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db, \n                   keyType = \"UNIPROT\", \n                   pvalueCutoff = 0.05, \n                   qvalueCutoff = 0.05, \n                   readable = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at the output.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nego_up\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#\n# over-representation test\n#\n#...@organism \t Homo sapiens \n#...@ontology \t MF \n#...@keytype \t UNIPROT \n#...@gene \t chr [1:468] \"O00622\" \"O43663\" \"P53350\" \"Q9NQS7\" \"O95235\" \"P09486\" \"P49454\" ...\n#...pvalues adjusted by 'BH' with cutoff <0.05 \n#...65 enriched terms found\n'data.frame':\t65 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ ID         : chr  \"GO:0016491\" \"GO:0005201\" \"GO:0005509\" \"GO:0005518\" ...\n $ Description: chr  \"oxidoreductase activity\" \"extracellular matrix structural constituent\" \"calcium ion binding\" \"collagen binding\" ...\n $ GeneRatio  : chr  \"65/460\" \"17/460\" \"35/460\" \"11/460\" ...\n $ BgRatio    : chr  \"232/3821\" \"26/3821\" \"105/3821\" \"18/3821\" ...\n $ pvalue     : num  7.01e-12 1.97e-10 5.26e-09 9.91e-07 1.04e-06 ...\n $ p.adjust   : num  3.16e-09 4.44e-08 7.90e-07 9.38e-05 9.38e-05 ...\n $ qvalue     : num  2.61e-09 3.68e-08 6.54e-07 7.77e-05 7.77e-05 ...\n $ geneID     : chr  \"PDIA4/P4HA2/P4HA1/PDIA3/POR/P4HB/ACADVL/PDIA6/P3H1/HIBADH/TXNDC5/HADHA/HSD17B4/TXNRD2/STEAP3/LOXL2/MTHFD2/HSDL2\"| __truncated__ \"CCN1/SPARC/THBS1/COL12A1/COL23A1/TNC/FN1/HAPLN1/EDIL3/LAMC2/COL6A3/LAMC1/EFEMP1/COL4A2/LAMA5/AGRN/TUFT1\" \"SPARC/THBS1/FSTL1/SPTAN1/HSPA5/NOTCH2/EDIL3/CALR/FKBP10/FKBP9/HSP90B1/LOXL2/NUCB1/TENM2/IQGAP1/PRKCSH/CRELD2/AC\"| __truncated__ \"SPARC/THBS1/MRC2/ITGB1/FN1/P3H1/SERPINH1/PPIB/ITGA3/CD44/CRTAP\" ...\n $ Count      : int  65 17 35 11 15 8 8 68 11 11 ...\n#...Citation\n T Wu, E Hu, S Xu, M Chen, P Guo, Z Dai, T Feng, L Zhou, W Tang, L Zhan, X Fu, S Liu, X Bo, and G Yu.\n clusterProfiler 4.0: A universal enrichment tool for interpreting omics data.\n The Innovation. 2021, 2(3):100141 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe output of the `enrichGO` function is an object of class `enrichResult` that\ncontains the `ID` and `Description` of all enriched GO terms.

They do not relate to specific biological systems e.g., cell type or condition.\n- GO enrichment analysis aims to identify GO terms that are present in a list of proteins of interest (foreground) at a higher frequency than expected by chance based on their frequency in a background list of proteins (universe). The universe should be a list of all proteins included identified and quantified in your experiment.\n- The `enrichGO` function from the `clusterProfiler` package provides a convenient way to carry out reproducible GO enrichment analysis in R.\n:::\n\n## References {-}",
