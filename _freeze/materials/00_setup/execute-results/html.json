If you want to setup\nyour own computer to run the analysis demonstrated on this course, you can\nfollow the instructions below.\n\n:::\n\n## Working on your own laptop\n\nThis lesson assumes that you have current versions of the following installed on \nyour computer:\n1. the [R software](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) itself, and\n2. [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).\nR and RStudio require separate downloads and installations. R itself refers to \nthe underlying language and computing environment required to write and read \nthis language. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment which\nessentially makes running R much easier and more interactive.  \n\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"os\"}\n#### Windows 10/11\n**If you already have a version of R and RStudio installed on your Windows system:**  \n*R*  \n- To check which version of R you are running, start RStudio and look at the \ninformation printed in the console. The first line should state \"R version x.x.x\n(date of install)\". Alternatively, type `sessionInfo()` to display the version \nof R that RStudio is currently running.\n- To confirm whether this version of R is the most current version, visit the\n[CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/). If a more recent\nversion of R is available, install it. \n- Although not necessary, if you wish to remove old versions of R from your \nsystem, see [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f) \nfor additional information.  \n*RStudio*\n- Open RStudio and click on \"Help\" > \"Check for updates\".  \n- If a new version of RStudio is available, quit RStudio and download the latest\nversion [see below].  \n  \n**If you do not yet have R and RStudio installed on your Windows system:**  \n*R*  \n- Download R from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).\n*RStudio*\n- Go to the [RStudio download page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download)\nand under *All Installers* select **RStudio xxxx.yy.zz-uuu.EXE - Windows 10/11**\n(where x, y, z and u represent version numbers). Double click the file to \ninstall it.\n- Once installed, open RStudio to ensure that it works and you don't have any \nerror messages. Check that the R version is as expected (the most up to date \naccording to the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)).\n\n#### Mac OS\n**If you already have a version of R and RStudio installed on your MacOS system:**  \n*R itself*\n- To check which version of R you are running, start RStudio and look at the \ninformation printed in the console. The first line should state \"R version x.x.x\n(date of install)\". Alternatively, type `sessionInfo()` to display the version \nof R that RStudio is currently running.\n- To confirm whether this version of R is the most current version, visit the\n[CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/). If a more recent\nversion of R is available, install it. \n- Although not necessary, if you wish to remove old versions of R from your \nsystem, see [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f) \nfor additional information.\n*RStudio*\n- Open RStudio and click on \"Help\" > \"Check for updates\".\n- If a new version of RStudio is available, quit RStudio and download the latest\nversion [see below].\n**If you do not yet have R and RStudio installed on your MacOS system:**  \n*R*\n- Download R from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) by \nclicking on the `.pkg` file for the latest release. Make sure you select the\ncorrect file depending on whether your mac is an M1/M2 Mac or an older Intel Mac. \nYou can check this on your mac by going to \"About this mac\" and checking the type\nof processer you have.\n- Double click on the downloaded file to install R.\n*RStudio*\n- Go to the [RStudio download page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download)\nand under *All Installers* select **RStudio xxxx.yy.zz-uuu.DMG - macOS 10.15+**\n(where x, y, z and u represent version numbers). Double click the file to \ninstall it.\n- Once installed, open RStudio to ensure that it works and you don't have any \nerror messages. Check that the R version is as expected (the most up to date \naccording to the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)).\n\n#### Linux\n*R*  \n- Follow the instructions for your distribution from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/).\nFor most distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu\nrun `sudo apt-get install r-base`, and for Fedora run `sudo yum install R`), but\nthis is not recommended as the versions installed by this approach are typically\nout of date.  \n  \n*R Studio*  \n- Go to the [RStudio download page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download)\nand under *All Installers* select the version that matches your distribution, \nand install it with your preferred method (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu \n`sudo dpkg -i rstudio-xxxx.yy.zz-uuu-amd64.deb` at the terminal).\n- Once installed, open RStudio to ensure that it works and you don't have any \nerror messages. Check that the R version is as expected (the most up to date \naccording to the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)).  \n\n:::\n",
