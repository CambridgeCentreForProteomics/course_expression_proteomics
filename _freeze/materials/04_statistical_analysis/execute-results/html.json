The aim of this section is to answer the question:\n*\"Which proteins show a significant change in abundance between cell cycle stages?\"*.\n\n\n\n## Using the empirical Bayes moderated t-test from the `Limma` package\n\n* Explain each term - Bayes moderated, t-test\n* Explain the concept of contrasts\n* Discuss the two types of limma model (trend = TRUE)\n\n\n## Diagnostic plots to verify suitability of our statistical model\n\n* p-value histogram \n* SA plot\n\n\n\n## Interpreting the output of our statisical model\n\n### Adding user-defined significance thresholds based on FDR and LFC\n\n* Discussion about p-value correction and why it is needed -> FDR as a method for this\n* Discussion about whether a log2FC threshold should also be set -> mention MS2 TMT ratio compression\n\n\n\n## Visualising the results of our statistical model\n\n* Volcano plot\n* MA plot\n* Adding error bars to show confidence interval \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Key Points\n\n- Last section of the page is a bulleted summary of the key points\n:::\n",
