Briefly, cells from a human cell \nline (U-2 0S) were treated with Nocodazole to inhibit the polymerisation of\nmicrotubules and block the transition beyond the prometaphase stage of M-phase.\nAfter 18-hours of treatment, the cells were released from cell cycle inhibition \nby withdrawing Nocodazole. Samples were taken in triplicate at 0, 6 and 23-hours\npost-withdrawl to generate 3 x M-phase samples, 3 x G1-phase samples and 3 x\ndesynchronised samples. A sample of cells was also taken prior to Nocodazole\ntreatment as an additional control, thus giving a total of 10 samples. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A schematic summary of the experimental design used to generate the use case data.](figs/experimental_plan_updated.png){#fig-experimental-method fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nTo measure protein abundance via bottom-up mass spectrometry, protein samples \nwere digested to peptides using trypsin (an enzyme which cleaves proteins at \nthe C-terminus of arginine and lysine residues, except where there is an \nadjacent proline residue). The same quantity of peptide from each sample was then\nlabelled using Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labels. This allows all of the samples to \nbe combined into a single pooled MS sample, thus reducing technical variability\nand MS time, as well as ensuring quantification of the same peptides in each \nsamples. The TMT labelling strategy is outlined below in @tbl-data-structure.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-data-structure .cell tbl-cap='Sample information and TMT labelling strategy in the use case experiment'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Sample Name |Timepoint     | Replicate|Tag  |\n|:-----------|:-------------|---------:|:----|\n|Control     |Pre-treatment |        NA|126  |\n|M_1         |0hrs          |         1|127N |\n|M_2         |0hrs          |         2|127C |\n|M_3         |0hrs          |         3|128N |\n|G1_1        |6hrs          |         1|128C |\n|G1_2        |6hrs          |         2|129N |\n|G1_3        |6hrs          |         3|129C |\n|DS_1        |23hrs         |         1|130N |\n|DS_2        |23hrs         |         2|130C |\n|DS_3        |23hrs         |         3|131  |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Isobaric peptide labelling using Tandem Mass Tags (TMT)\n\nAs outlined above, the use-case experiment made use of tandem mass tag (TMT)\nlabelling. TMT reagents are **isobaric** chemical labels that can be covalently\nlinked to peptide amine groups, either at the peptide N-terminus or at lysine\n(K) residues. These reagents are currently available in kits (referred to as\nTMTplexes) containing 6 (TMT6plex^TM^), 10 (TMT10plex^TM^), 16 (TMTpro\n16plex^TM^), 18 (TMTpro 18plex^TM^) or 32 (TMTpro 32plex^TM^) TMT labels.\nFurther, kits can be combined to multiplex up to 35 samples. The isobaric nature\nof TMT reagents means that all of the labels within a TMTplex have the same\noverall mass. However, they differ in how this mass is distributed between their\ntwo variable regions - the **reporter** and **mass normaliser**. The structure\nof a TMT label is shown below in @fig-tmt-structure.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The chemical structure of a TMT label.](figs/tmt_structure.jpg){#fig-tmt-structure fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAfter labelling each sample with a different TMT reagent, the same peptide will\nhave an identical mass but be differentially labelled across samples. The\nsamples are then pooled together and run on the MS as a single **multiplexed**\nsample. In the MS1 spectra it is not possible to distinguish how much of each\npeptide (peak) was derived from each sample because all of the labelled peptides\nstill have the same overall mass. During fragmentation, however, a cleavable\nlinker within the TMT label is broken, thereby releasing a section of the label\ncalled the **reporter ion**. The mass of this reporter ion is different between\nTMT labels due to differences in the distribution of isotopes (C^13^ and N^15^)\nbetween the **mass reporter** and **mass normalizer** regions. As a result, the\nspectra of fragment ions will contain one peak per reporter ion and the relative\nintensity of these ions can be used to calculate the relative abundance of the\nidentified peptide across the labelled samples. This is summarised below in\n@fig-tmt-quant.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Relative peptide quantitation using TMT labels. Image modified from Thermo Fisher Scientific.](figs/tmt_quant.png){#fig-tmt-quant fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis means that TMT labelling can be used for the **relative quantification** of \npeptides (and in turn proteins) across samples. Here we will use the relative\nreporter ion intensity of our TMT labels to compare abundance between samples\ntaken throughout the cell cycle. If we wanted to carry out absolute quantification \nof proteins, TMT labelling would not be an appropriate method.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## MS2- vs. MS3-based TMT quantitaion\n\nOriginally the reporter ion of a TMT reagent was released by fragmentation of \nthe precursor peptide. This meant that the reporter ion signals could be \ncalculated based on MS2 spectra, and hence TMT quantitation was done at the MS2\nlevel. However, different precursor peptides can have very similar m/z values,\nresulting in their MS1 peaks being very close together. When one of these\nprecursors is selected for fragmentation it is possible for other precursors to\nbe unintentionally co-isolated within the same fragmentation window. This \nresults in **co-isolation interference** since the reporter ions present at MS2\nare not only from the identified peptide but also any other co-isolated peptides.\n\nMore recently, MS3-based quantitation has been applied to reduce the problem of\nco-isolation interference and increase quantitation accuracy when using TMT labels\n@Ting2011. In this approach the initial round of precursor fragmentation only uses \na weak fragmentation method (e.g., collision induced dissociation, CID) to ensure\nthat TMT reporter ions are not broken off at MS2. The most abundance fragment ions\nfrom MS2 are then selected for a second round of fragmentation, this time using\na stronger force (e.g., high-energy collision dissociation) so that the TMT\nreporter ions are released. Since the MS2 fragment ions derived from the intended\nprecursor peptide are more abundant than the unwanted MS2 fragments from \nco-isolated peptides, the MS3 fragments and reporter ions provide a much cleaner\nquantitation of the identified precursor peptide. The MS3 reporter ion \nquantitation is almost purely from the peptide that we want, not from a mixture\nof all co-isolated peptides.\n\nThe specific MS3 data acquisition approach used to generate our data was \nsynchronous precursor selection (SPS)-MS3. In simple terms, the SPS method \nallows us to select multiple MS2 fragments for additional fragmentation to the\nMS3 level, rather than just one @McAlister2014.\n:::\n\n## Identification search of the raw MS data\n\nHaving analysed the pooled TMT sample via MS, the raw MS were processed using \nProteome Discoverer v3.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). This software is one of \nseveral that can be used to carry out a database search to identify and \nquantify peptide sequences, and therefore proteins, from raw MS data. Others \ninclude [MaxQuant](https://www.maxquant.org), \n[FragPipe](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org) and\n[PEAKS](https://www.bioinfor.com/peaks-online/) among others.\n\nBriefly, database searching of MS data involves comparing the observed MS spectra\nto expected MS spectra generated via in silico digestion of a selected protein \ndatabase. Since the use-case data used human cells, we provided the human proteome\nto Proteome Discoverer as the database for searching. We also provided a \ndatabase of common contaminants that could be present in our sample due to (i)\nhuman contamination (e.g., keratin from nails, hair or skin), or (ii) sample\npreparation (e.g., enzymes used for protein digestion). These two databases are\ncan be found in the course materials and also at\n[https://zenodo.org/records/7837375](https://zenodo.org/records/7837375). The\nresult of such a database search is a list of **peptide spectrum matches\n(PSMs)**, that is a list of matches between observed and expected spectra. Most\nsoftware will also aggregate the PSM level data upward and provide output files\nat all data levels (PSM, peptide and protein). It is up to the user which output\nfile to use for further analysis.\n\nThe starting point for this workshop and data processing workflow in R is an \noutput file from the identification search. Proteome Discoverer provides each \ndata level output as a separate `.txt` file. Here, we will use the PSM-level\n`.txt` file. \n\n\n## Starting analysis from PSM, peptide or protein level\n\nIn general, to allow for maximum control of data quality, normalisation and\naggregation it is advisable to begin analysis from the lowest possible data \nlevel. This will ensure a greater understanding of the data and facilitate\ntransparency throughout the process. \n\nFor TMT data we can start our data analysis from the PSM level. However, it is\nnot always possible to start at this level. Some algorithms used to process \nlabel-free data may require the data to be analysed from the peptide-level. See\n[Adapting this workflow to label-free proteomics](./11_lfq_vs_tmt.html) for \nmore details.\n\n## Summary\nThe use-case data that we will process and analyse in this workshop is a **DDA**\n**TMT-labelled** **bottom-up** proteomics dataset. The aim of the experiment is\nto calculate **relative protein abundances** between samples. This will then allow \nus to apply statistical tests to determine whether any proteins have significantly\ndifferent abundances relative to each other.\n\nAlthough many of the processing and analysis steps discussed in this course are\nalso applicable to other types of proteomics datasets (particularly label-free\nDDA bottom-up proteomics), there is no one-size-fits-all workflow for expression\nproteomics. Some aspects of the workflow would need to be adapted for other\ntypes of proteomics experiment. We have provided details on how this workflow \ncould be adapted to [label-free data](./11_lfq_vs_tmt.html) or \n[data processed using MaxQuant](./10_maxquant_notes.html) rather than Proteome Discoverer.\n\n\n## Glossary\n\nKey terms that you should understand for this workshop:\n\n- **Precursor ion** = the original parent ion representing an ionized form of the entire peptide sequence.\n\n- **Fragment ion** = an ion produced by fragmentation of the precursor ion, thus only representing a fraction of the original peptide sequence.\n\n- **MS1 spectrum** = raw mass spectrum produced by the separation of precursor ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). Each peak represents a precursor ion at a particular m/z and with an associated intensity.\n\n- **MS2 (MS/MS) spectrum** = raw mass spectrum produced by the separation of fragment ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). Each peak corresponds to a fragment ion derived from the same precursor ion.\n\n- **Peptide spectrum match (PSM)** =  A match made between a theoretical mass spectrum for a given peptide sequence and an observed experimental spectrum, thus linking a raw mass spectrum to its predicted peptide sequence\n\n- **Tandem mass tag (TMT)** = a type of peptide label which can be used for relative quantification of peptides across samples. Quantification is measured at the MS2 or MS3 level.\n\n\n## References {-}\n",
