Nevertheless, the workflow and basic principles\ndiscussed are also applicable to the output of any similar proteomics raw data \nprocessing software, including MaxQuant, among others.\n\nHere we have outlined the differences to be aware of when following this course \nusing MaxQuant output text files. The code as written will require some minor \nmodifications to work properly with MaxQuant formatted data.\n\n1. The rough equivalent of the `PSMs.txt` file output by Proteome Discoverer is \nthe `evidence.txt` file output by MaxQuant.\n\n2. Decoy PSMs (known false discoveries which are used to calculate false discovery\nrate) are automatically filtered out by Proteome Discoverer, but this is not the \ncase with MaxQuant. Hence when working with MaxQuant outputs it is important to\nfilter out rows with '+' in the `Reverse` column.\n\n3. Equivalent column names and the type of data contained are described below. \nEllipses are put where no equivalent column exists. \n<!-- (PD PSMs.txt column = MaxQuant evidence.txt column): -->\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n#### Naming of column headers in third party softwares\nColumn names are not only different between different softwares but also\nbetween different versions of the same software. Always check the column\nnames and that they correspond to what you expect.\n:::\n\n#### PSM or peptide level files\n\n| Proteome Discoverer (PSMs.txt) | MaxQuant (evidence.txt) |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| `Abundance` (float) | `Reporter.intensity.corrected` (integer) |\n| `Sequence` (string) | `Sequence` (string) |\n| `Master.Protein.Accessions` (string) | `Leading.proteins` (string) |\n| `Contaminants` (string, True or False) | `Potential.contaminant` (string, + or blank) |\n| ... | `Reverse` (string, + or blank) |\n| `Rank` (integer) | ... |\n| `Search.Engine.Rank` (integer) | ... |\n| `PSM.Ambiguity` (string) | ... |\n| `Number.of.Protein.Groups` (integer) | ...
