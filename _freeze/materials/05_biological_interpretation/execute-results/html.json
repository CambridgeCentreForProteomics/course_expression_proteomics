We can get an initial idea about what these proteins are and do by \nlooking at the protein descriptions. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWhilst we may recognise some of the changing proteins, this might be the first\ntime that we are coming across others. Moreover, some protein descriptions \ncontain useful information, but this is very limited. We still want to find out\nmore about the biological role of the statistically significant proteins so that\nwe can infer the potential effects of their abundance changes. \n\nThere are many functional analyses that could be done on the proteins with\ndifferential abundance:\n\n* Investigate the biological pathways that the proteins function within (KEGG etc.)\n* Identify potential interacting partners (IntAct, String.dc etc.)\n* Determine the subcellular localisation in which the changing proteins are found \n* Understand the co-regulation of their mRNAs (Expression Atlas)\n* Compare our changing proteins to those previously identified in other proteomic\nstudies of the cell cycle\n\n## Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis \n\nOne of the common methods used to probe the biological relevance of proteins with\nsignificant changes in abundance between conditions is to carry out Gene Ontology \n(GO) enrichment, or over-representation, analysis. \n\nThe Gene Ontology consortium have defined a set of hierarchical descriptions to \nbe assigned to genes and their resulting proteins. These descriptions are split\ninto three categories: cellular components (CC), biological processes (BP) and\nmolecular function (MF). The idea is to provide information about a protein's\nsubcellular localisation, functionality and which processes it contributes to\nwithin the cell. Hence, the overarching aim of GO enrichment analysis is to \nanswer the question: \n\n*\"Given a list of proteins found to be differentially abundant in my phenotype of interest, what are the cellular components, molecular functions and biological processes involved in this phenotype?\".*\n\nUnfortunately, just looking at the GO terms associated with our differentially\nabundant proteins is insufficient to draw any solid conclusions. For example, if\nwe find that **xx** of the **xx** proteins significantly upregulated in G1 phase\nare annotated with the GO term \" xxx \", it may seem intuitive to conclude that \nthis biological process is important for the G1 phenotype. However, if \n\nThis leads us to the concept of an over-representation analysis. We wish to ask \nwhether any GO terms are over-represented (i.e., present at a higher frequency \nthan expected by chance) in our lists of differentially abundant proteins. In \nother words, we need to know how many proteins with a GO term *could* have\nshown differential abundance in our experiment vs. how many proteins with this\nGO term *did* show differential abundance in our experiment. \n\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### Key Points\n\n- Last section of the page is a bulleted summary of the key points\n:::\n",
