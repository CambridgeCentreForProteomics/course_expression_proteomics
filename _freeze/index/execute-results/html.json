Breckels - Cambridge Centre for Proteomcis, University of Cambridge\n* Charlotte Hutchings - Cambridge Centre for Proteomcis, University of Cambridge\n* Charlotte S. Dawson - Cambridge Centre for Proteomcis, University of Cambridge\n* Thomas Krueger - Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge\n\n## Authors\n<!-- \nThe listing below shows an example of how you can give more details about yourself.\nThese examples include icons with links to GitHub and Orcid. \n-->\n\nAbout the authors:\n\n- **Charlotte Hutchings**\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/Charl-Hutchings\" target=\"_blank\"><i class=\"fa-brands fa-github\" style=\"color:#4078c0\"></i></a>  \n  _Affiliation_: Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge  \n  _Roles_: writing - original draft; conceptualisation; coding\n- **Lisa Breckels**\n  <a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8918-7171\" target=\"_blank\"><i class=\"fa-brands fa-orcid\" style=\"color:#a6ce39\"></i></a> \n  <a href=\"https://github.com/lmsimp\" target=\"_blank\"><i class=\"fa-brands fa-github\" style=\"color:#4078c0\"></i></a>  \n  _Affiliation_: Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge  \n  _Roles_: writing - original draft; conceptualisation; coding\n\n\n## Citation\n\n<!-- We can do this at the end -->\n\nPlease cite these materials if:\n\n- You adapted or used any of them in your own teaching.\n- These materials were useful for your research work.
