If you want to setup\nyour own computer to run the analysis demonstrated on this course, you can\nfollow the instructions below.\n:::\n\n## Data\n\nThe data used in these materials is provided as a zip file. \nDownload and unzip the folder to your Desktop to follow along with the materials.\n\n<!-- Note for Training Developers: add the link to 'href' -->\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/9plgp7pie1uivaijqo14c/ABPdE9x2a3wwX5LkNJ2V_EY?rlkey=bhgv86ihvsu4z8ibmp0rsg98l&st=magy6j2f&dl=1\">  \n<button class=\"btn\"><i class=\"fa fa-download\"></i> Download</button>\n</a>\n\n## Working on your own laptop\n\nIf you wish to work on your own laptop during the course and not the training\nmachines you will need to have the latest stable versions of R, RStudio and\nBioconductor including the packages listed below.\n\n### R and RStudio\n\nThis lesson assumes that you have current versions of the following installed on \nyour computer:\n\n1. The [R software](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) itself, and\n2. [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).\n\nR and RStudio require separate downloads and installations. R itself refers to \nthe underlying language and computing environment required to write and read \nthis language. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment which\nessentially makes running R much easier and more interactive.  \n\n<!-- ### Quarto -->\n\n<!-- To develop and render the course materials website, you will need to install _Quarto_: -->\n\n<!-- - Download and install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) (available for all major OS).  -->\n<!-- - If you are developing materials using executable `.qmd` documents, it is recommended that you also install the extensions for your favourite IDE (e.g. RStudio, VS Code). -->\n<!-- - If you are developing materials using **JupyterLab** or **Jupyter Notebooks**, please install [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). -->\n<!--   - Use the [paired notebook](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paired-notebooks.html) feature to have synchronised `.ipynb`/`.qmd` files. Only `.qmd` files should be pushed to the repository (`.ipynb` files have been added to `.gitignore`). -->\n\n\n::: {.tabset group=\"os\"}\n\n#### Windows\n\nDownload and install all these using default options:\n\n- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.html)\n- [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)\n- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)\n\n#### Mac OS\n\nDownload and install all these using default options:\n\n- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)\n- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)\n\n#### Linux\n\n- Go to the [R installation](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/) folder and look at the instructions for your distribution.\n- Download the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installer for your distribution and install it using your package manager.\n\n:::\n\n### R package installation\n\nIn this workshop we make use of open-source software from the \n[R](https://www.r-project.org) [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) \n[@Huber2015] project. The [Bioconductor initiative](https://bioconductor.org) \nprovides [R](https://www.r-project.org) software packages dedicated\nto the processing of high-throughput complex biological data. Packages are\nopen-source, well-documented and benefit from an active community of developers.\n\nDetailed instructions for the installation of Bioconductor packages are\ndocumented on the [Bioconductor Installation page](http://bioconductor.org/install/). \nThe main packages required for this workshop are installed using the code below.\nAdditional packages required for downstream statistics and interpretation are\ninstalled as required.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!require(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE)) {\n  install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n}\n\nBiocManager::install(c(\"QFeatures\",\n                       \"NormalyzerDE\",\n                       \"limma\",\n                       \"factoextra\",\n                       \"org.Hs.eg.db\",\n                       \"clusterProfiler\",\n                       \"enrichplot\",\n                       \"patchwork\",\n                       \"tidyverse\",\n                       \"pheatmap\",\n                       \"ggupset\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter installation, each package must be loaded before it can be used in the R\nsession. This is achieved via the `library` function.

Scroll down to the section named \"_EOL_\" and choose \"_\\\\n_\" (this will ensure that the files you edit on Windows are compatible with the Linux operating system).\n\n#### Mac OS\n\n- Go to the [Visual Studio Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and download the installer for Mac.\n- Go to the Downloads folder and double-click the file you just downloaded to extract the application. Drag-and-drop the \"Visual Studio Code\" file to your \"Applications\" folder. \n- You can now open the installed application to check that it was installed successfully (the first time you launch the application you will get a warning that this is an application downloaded from the internet - you can go ahead and click \"Open\").\n\n#### Linux (Ubuntu)\n\n- Go to the [Visual Studio Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and download the installer for your Linux distribution. Install the package using your system's installer.\n\n:::\n -->\n\n# References\n",
