Before we carry out statistical analysis to determine which of our proteins 
show significantly differential abundance across conditions (cell cycle stages),
we first want to do some exploration of the protein level data. This includes
determining some information that may be required for reporting and publication
purposes as well as information corresponding to quality control.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "90%"}

```


## Determining the dimensions of our final protein data

Given that we started from the PSM level and did extensive data cleaning, 
filtering and management of missing data, it would be useful to know how much 
data we have left. We may want to know how many PSMs, peptides and proteins
the `log_norm_proteins` assay contains, given that this is the data to which
statistical analysis will be applied.

We can easily find the number master proteins by printing our `QFeatures` object

```{r}
cc_qf
```

We can see we have `r nrow(cc_qf[["log_norm_proteins"]])` master proteins, each
representing a protein group.

```{r}
cc_qf[["log_norm_proteins"]] %>%
  nrow()
```


:::{.callout-exercise}
#### Challenge 1: Final PSM, peptide and protein count
{{< level 2 >}}

Determine how many PSMs, peptides and proteins were lost during processing of
the raw data to our final protein list?

::: {.callout-answer collapse=true}

We started with,

```{r}
psm_count <- cc_qf[["psms_raw"]] %>% nrow()

peptide_count <- 
  cc_qf[["psms_raw"]] %>%
  rowData() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  pull(Sequence) %>%
  unique() %>%
  length() 

prot_count <- 
  cc_qf[["psms_raw"]] %>%
  rowData() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  pull(Master.Protein.Accessions) %>%
  unique() %>%
  length() 

message(psm_count, " PSMs, ", 
        peptide_count, " peptides and ", 
        prot_count, " protein groups")
```

After filtering we have,

```{r}
psm_final <- cc_qf[["psms_filtered"]] %>% nrow()

peptide_final <- cc_qf[["peptides"]] %>% nrow()

prot_final <- cc_qf[["log_norm_proteins"]] %>% nrow()

message(psm_final, " PSMs, ", 
        peptide_final, " peptides and ", 
        prot_final, " protein groups")
```

During the course of data processing we have lost,

```{r}
message(psm_count - psm_final, " PSMs, ", 
        peptide_count - peptide_final, " peptides and ", 
        prot_count - prot_final, " protein groups")
```

## The `.n` column created by `aggregateFeatures`

If we look at the names of the columns within our "`peptides"` and
`"proteins"` experimental assays we see that there is a column called `.n`. 
This column was not present in the PSM level experimental assays.

For example,

```{r}
## Check columns in the log normalised peptide assay
cc_qf[["peptides"]] %>%
  rowData() %>%
  names()
```

The `.n` column is created during the aggregation process that is completed via
the `aggregateFeatures` function. This column stores information about how many
child features (PSMs/peptides) were aggregated into each parent
(peptides/protein) feature. Since we aggregated completed two steps of
aggregation (1) PSMs to peptides, (2) peptides to proteins, the `.n` column
in `"peptides"` tells us how many PSMs we have in support of each peptide,
and in `"proteins"` how many peptides we have in support of each master protein.

Let's examine peptide support,

```{r}
cc_qf[["log_norm_proteins"]] %>%
  rowData() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  pull(.n) %>%
  table()
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
.support <- 
  cc_qf[["log_norm_proteins"]] %>%
  rowData() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  pull(.n) %>%
  table()
```

The output tells us that we have `r .support[1]` proteins with `r names(.support[1])` 
peptides, `r .support[2]` proteins with support from `r names(.support[2])` peptides, and so forth.

:::{.callout-exercise}
#### Challenge 2: Examining peptide support
{{< level 2 >}}

1. Using the information we have in the `.n` column create a graph to visualise
peptide support. 

<details><summary>Inspiration</summary> The ["from Data to Viz project"](https://www.data-to-viz.com)
provides some great ideas for visualisation in R and a brilliant platform for 
exploring your data. The [R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html)
is another great source of inspiration with coded examples to follow.</details>

2. What is,

(i) the *maximum* number of peptides we have available for one given protein? 
(ii) the *most common* number of peptides available for any given protein?
(iii) the *median* number of peptides available for any given protein?

<details><summary>Hint</summary> The functions `table` and `summary`
may help. </details>


::: {.callout-answer collapse=true}

**Task 1: Graph to visualise peptide support**

There are many ways we can visualise peptide support. The first thing we could do
is plot a histogram. 


```{r}
cc_qf[["log_norm_proteins"]] %>%
  rowData() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = .n)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

Is this a good visualisation for our dataset? It is perhaps not the easiest plot
to read if the aim is to get an overview of how many peptides are available per
protein group.

Let's bin peptides with > 8 peptides per protein group into one category and
then plot the data.

In the next code chunk we create a new `tibble` which tells us how many
proteins we have which have `n` number of peptides.

```{r}
## Summarise the number of peptides per protein if we have greater than 8  
peptide_df <- cc_qf[["log_norm_proteins"]] %>%
  rowData() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(.n) %>% 
  mutate(peptide_n = ifelse(.n <= 7, .n, "8+")) %>% 
  count(peptide_n) 

peptide_df
```

Now let's plot this data.

```{r}
## Plot the data using a lollipop
ggplot(peptide_df, aes(x = peptide_n, y = n)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = peptide_n, xend = peptide_n, y=0, yend = n)) +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 4) +
  ylab("Frequency") +
  xlab("Number of peptides per protein group") +
  theme_light() 
```

We can also plot as a percentage.

```{r}
## Plot the data using a lollipop
peptide_df %>% 
  mutate(n, n_percent = n/sum(n)*100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = peptide_n, y = n_percent)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = peptide_n, xend = peptide_n, y = 0, yend = n_percent)) +
  geom_point(color="red", size=4) +
  ylab("Frequency (%)") +
  xlab("Number of peptides per protein group") +
  theme_light()
```

**Task 2: Peptides support, summary statistics**

Let's again pull the column `.n` and tabulate the output

```{r}
cc_qf[["log_norm_proteins"]] %>%
  rowData() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  pull(.n) %>% 
  table()
```

Let's now calculate summary statistics to find the median number of peptides,

```{r}
cc_qf[["log_norm_proteins"]] %>%
  rowData() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  pull(.n) %>% 
  summary()
```

(i) We have one instance which has 223 peptides for one given protein.
(ii) From the above output we see the most common number of peptides available to support
a given protein is 1. Single peptide hits most frequently occur in the data. 
(iii) The median number of peptides is 2.

## The `subsetByFeature` function

As well as determining the dimensions of our entire dataset, both in its raw
state and its final state, sometimes we may wish to find out information about 
a specific feature e.g., a protein of interest. The `QFeatures` infrastructure
provides a convenient function called `subsetByFeature` to extract all data 
levels corresponding to a particular feature.

The `subsetByFeature` function take a `QFeatures` object as its input and an 
additional argument specifying one or more features of interest. The output is
a new `QFeatures` object with only data corresponding to the specified features.

Let's take a look at O43583, the human density-regulated protein.

```{r}
O43583 <- subsetByFeature(cc_qf, "O43583")

experiments(O43583)
```

From this we can see that the O43583 protein is supported by 4 peptides derived
from 5 PSMs.

We can use our new `QFeatures` object to create a plot which displays how the
PSM data was aggregated to protein for this particular feature. To do so, we
extract the assays of interest from our `"O43583"` `QFeatures` object and pass
to the `longFormat` function which will covert the subset `QFeatures` object
to a long format `DataFrame`. We can then use the standard `ggplot2` functions
to visualise the processing of this protein.


```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
O43583[, , c("psms_filtered", "peptides", "proteins")] %>%
  longFormat() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(assay_order = factor(assay, 
                              levels = c("psms_filtered", 
                                         "peptides", 
                                         "proteins"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = colname, y = log2(value), colour = assay)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = rowname)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, size = 7)) +
  facet_wrap(~ assay_order)
```

Other useful functions that we do not have time to cover today include
`subsetByAssay`, `subsetByColData`, `subsetByColumn`, `subsetByFilter`, 
`subsetByRow`, `subsetByOverlap`, and many more. To find out more about these 
functions you can execute a single question mark (`?`) followed by the function name. 
If you have the `QFeatures` package installed you should be able to access a help
and information page for the function of interest.

For example: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?subsetByAssay
```


## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

The final protein level exploration that we will do is Principal Component
Analysis (PCA).

PCA is a statistical method that can be applied to condense complex data from
large data tables into a smaller set of summary indices, termed principal 
components. This process of dimensionality reduction makes it easier to 
understand the variation observed in a dataset, both how much variation there is
and what the primary factors driving the variation are. This is particularly 
important for multivariate datasets in which experimental factors can contribute
differentially or cumulatively to variation in the observed data. PCA allows us
to observe any trends, clusters and outliers within the data thereby helping to
uncover the relationships between observations and variables.


### The process of PCA

The process of PCA can be considered in several parts:

1. Scaling and centering the data

Firstly, all continuous variables are standardized into the same range so that 
they can contribute equally to the analysis. This is done by centering each
variable to have a mean of 0 and scaling its standard deviation to 1.


2. Generation of a covariance matrix

After the data has been standardized, the next step is to calculate a covariance
matrix. The term covariance refers to a measure of how much two variables vary
together. For example, the height and weight of a person in a population will 
be somewhat correlated, thereby resulting in covariance within the population.
A covariance matrix is a square matrix of dimensions *p* x *p* (where *p* is 
the number of dimensions in the original dataset i.e., the number of variables).
The matrix contains an entry for every possible pair of variables and describes
how the variables are varying with respect to each other.

Overall, the covariance matrix is essentially a table which summarises the 
correlation between all possible pairs of variables in the data. If the covariance
of a pair is positive, the two variables are correlated in some direction (increase
or decrease together). If the covariance is negative, the variables are inversely
correlated with one increasing when the other decreases. If the covariance is 
near-zero, the two variables are not expected to have any relationship.


3. Eigendecomposition - calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors

Eigendecomposition is a concept in linear algebra whereby a data matrix is 
represented in terms of **eigenvalues** and **eigenvectors**. In this case, the
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are calculated based on the covariance matrix
and will inform us about the magnitude and direction of our data. Each eigenvector
represents a direction in the data with a corresponding eigenvalue telling us how 
much variation in our data occurs in that direction.

* Eigenvector = informs about the direction of variation
* Eigenvalue = informs about the magnitude of variation 

The number of eigenvectors and eigenvalues will always be the same as the 
number of dimensions (variables) in the initial dataset. In our use-case, we 
have 10 samples, so we will have a covariance matrix of dimensions 10 x 10, and
this will give rise to 10 eigenvectors and 10 associated eigenvalues.


4. The calculation of principal components

Principal components are calculated by multiplying the original data by a 
corresponding eigenvector. As a result, the principal components themselves
represent directionality of data. The order of the principal components is
determined by the corresponding eigenvector such that the first principal 
component is that which explains the most variation in the data (i.e., has the
largest eigenvalue).

By having the first principal components explain the largest proportion of 
variation in the data, the dimension of the data can be reduced by focusing
on these principal components and ignoring those which explain very little in 
the data.


### Completing PCA with `prcomp`

To carry out PCA on our data we will use the `prcomp` function from the `stats`
package. We first extract the quantitative matrix (assay) corresponding to the
log normalised protein level data. To make this matrix compatible with `prcomp`
we also need to transpose the data such that the samples become rows and 
proteins become columns. This is easily achieved using the `t` function. 

Our protein data does not contain missing values.
However, if there were any missing values in the data, these would need to be 
removed using `filterNA` to facilitate compatibility with PCA.


```{r}
protein_pca <- cc_qf[["log_norm_proteins"]] %>%
  assay() %>%
# filterNA() %>%
  t() %>%
  prcomp(scale = TRUE, center = TRUE)

summary(protein_pca)
```


We now have a simplified representation of our quantitative data in the form
of principle components (PC). The `prcomp` function outputs a list of 5 different
information sources, each of which can be accessed using the `$` sign nomenclature.

1. `sdev` - holds the standard deviation values for each of the principle components
2. `rotation` - a matrix which contains each of our proteins as a row and the corresponding PC values as columns
3. `x` - a matrix which contains each of our samples as a row and the corresponding PC values as columns
4. `center` - if `center = TRUE` then contains the centering values, otherwise `FALSE`
5. `scale` - if `scale = TRUE` then contains the scaling values, otherwise `FALSE`


To visualise the resulting PCs and how much of the data variation they explain
we can plot a scree plot using the `fviz_screeplot` function. The resulting plot
displays the proportion of total data variation explained by each of PC.


```{r}
fviz_screeplot(protein_pca)
```


Looking at a scree plot can be useful when deciding which principle components
to plot and investigate further. We now want to plot each of our samples in PCA 
space. To do this we will use the `protein_pca$x` data. Typically a 2D PCA plot
will display PC1 and PC2, since these are the PCs that explain the most variation 
within the dataset, but it can also be useful to plot later PCs if they also 
explain a large proportion of variation.


```{r}
protein_pca$x %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) + 
  theme_bw()
```


It is generally advisable to colour each point based on all possible explanatory
variables that may have contributed to the observed variation. In our case we
only have one - the cell cycle stage.

1. Generate a PCA plot of the data and colour by condition.

<details><summary>Hint</summary>To colour the points based on this condition

  geom_point(size = 3) + 
  theme_bw()
```

**Task 2**

This PCA plot shows clear clustering of samples based on their condition, which
is what we would hope to see. This indicates that the observed variation could 
indeed be explained by cell cycle stage.
:::
:::



For more complicated multivariate experiments all possible explanatory 
variables should be visualised. For example, if multiple batches of samples 
have been prepared separately or several TMTplexes were used, these factors
should be visualised (e.g., by colour) on the PCA plot to see whether they 
are contributing the the observed variation. If the samples do cluster based on
unwanted factors such as batch or TMTplex, additional normalisation may be 
required.
