# Analysis of expression proteomics data in R {.unnumbered}

## Overview 

These materials focus on expression proteomics, which aims to characterise the protein diversity and abundance in a particular system. 
You will learn about the bioinformatic analysis steps involved when working with these kind of data, in particular several dedicated proteomics Bioconductor packages, part of the R programming language.
We will use a real-world dataset obtained from a tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry experiment. 
We cover the basic data structures used to store and manipulate protein abundance data, how to do quality control and filtering of the data, as well as several visualisations. 
Finally, we include statistical analysis of differential abundance across sample groups (e.g. control vs. treated) and further evaluation and biological interpretation of the results via gene ontology analysis.

### Learning Objectives

You will learn about:

- How mass spectrometry can be used to quantify protein abundance and some of the methods used for peptide quantitation.
- The bioinformatics steps involved in processing and analysing expression proteomics data.
- How to assess the quality of your data, deal with missing values and summarise peptide-level data to protein-level.
- How to perform differential expression analysis to compare protein abundances between different groups of samples.

### Target Audience

Proteomics practitioners or data analysts/bioinformaticians that would like to learn how to use R to analyse proteomics data.


### Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of mass spectometry.
  * Watch this [iBiology video](https://youtu.be/eNKMdVMglvI) for an excellent overview. 
* A working knowledge of R and the tidyverse.
* Familiarity with other Bioconductor data classes, such as those used for RNA-seq analysis, is useful but not required. 

<!-- Training Developer note: comment the following section out if you did not assign levels to your exercises -->
### Exercises

Exercises in these materials are labelled according to their level of difficulty:

| Level | Description |
| ----: | :---------- |
| {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa regular star >}} {{< fa regular star >}} | Exercises in level 1 are simpler and designed to get you familiar with the concepts and syntax covered in the course. |
| {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa regular star >}} | Exercises in level 2 combine different concepts together and apply it to a given task. |
| {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa solid star >}} | Exercises in level 3 require going beyond the concepts and syntax introduced to solve new problems. |
